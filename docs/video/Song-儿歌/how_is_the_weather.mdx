# How's the Weather

## Singing an English Children's Song and Learning About the Weather | How's the Weather | SSS Song

In this video, we have the classic English children's song "How's the Weather" from SSS (Super Simple Song). This is Katherine teacher's first song with the theme "Weather". The key English vocabulary in this video includes: sunny, rainy, cloudy, snowy. The key sentence patterns include: How's the weather? / Let's look outside. / Is it sunny...?

I believe that through fun movements and music, children will be able to learn English oral expressions related to the weather.
