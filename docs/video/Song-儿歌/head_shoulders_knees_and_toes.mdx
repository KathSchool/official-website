# Head Shoulders Knees and Toes

## Classic English Children's Song | Head Shoulders Knees and Toes | Learning Body Parts

In this video, we have the classic English children's song "Head Shoulders Knees and Toes". The lively and adorable Katherine teacher leads the kids in singing and dancing to this English song, making it a fun and easy way to learn body parts vocabulary.

I believe that after singing and dancing a few times, the children will be able to remember the related words. The song is very catchy, so parents, let's get your little ones to start learning it!
