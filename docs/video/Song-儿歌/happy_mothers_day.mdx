## Sing a Lovely Song for Mom! | Mother's Day

Mother's Day is coming, and I want to wish all the moms out there a happy holiday in advance. You all work so hard!

In this video, we will learn the beautiful and sweet English song "I Love My Mommy". I hope the children can sing it to their moms on Mother's Day to express their love and gratitude.

The lyrics of this song are simple, and the melody is beautiful. Let's get the kids to learn it right away!
