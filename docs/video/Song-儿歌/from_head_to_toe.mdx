# From Head to Toe

## English Nursery Rhyme and Dance: From Head to Toe | Song and Dance for Kids

In this video, we dance and sing to the classic English picture book "From Head to Toe". The song and dance format can deepen children's impression and affection for the book. We hope that through the last session of picture book reading and this session of singing and dancing, children can output repeated sentences in the book: "Can you do it? / I can do it!" and vocabulary related to animals and body parts. If you want your children to easily read this book, let them sing and dance to this song a few more times!
