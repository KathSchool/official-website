## Children's English Picture Book: The Animal Race - The Story of Chinese Zodiac

Happy New Year, dear children and parents!
I am Teacher Katherine, and starting from today, I will bring you a series of children's English lessons.
In this video, with the theme of Chinese New Year, we will share an English picture book with children: "The Animal Race - The Story of Chinese Zodiac." This picture book is fun and easy to understand. Children can not only learn about the origins of the Chinese Zodiac but also immerse themselves in an all-English context to learn a second language, sharpen their ears, and acquire vocabulary related to animals.
