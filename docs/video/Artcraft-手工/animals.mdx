# Color animals

## Color Grandpa Karl's Classic Animals

In this video, let's color together while reviewing and reinforcing the classic picture book "Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?" that we've learned before.

Coloring is kids' favorite activity! In today's coloring session, children can not only explore the world of colors but also review the animals and color vocabulary they have learned. Moreover, it's an excellent way to exercise their fine motor skills, which brings tremendous benefits to English enlightenment for little ones!
