## Introduction

This is the third installment of the Hungry Caterpillar series, where we'll be drawing a caterpillar together with the children!
Children often enjoy hands-on creations, so let's review this classic picture book and create together!
In this video, we'll cover topics such as fruits, numbers, days of the week, colors, and expressions for fingers.
