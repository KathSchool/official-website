In this video, we bring you a parent-child activity class with an Opposites theme, where we'll be making a Day and Night Paper Plate Craft.
This craft is not only beautiful and fun, but the all-English context also helps children develop their English speaking and listening skills.
Additionally, activities such as coloring, drawing, and paper cutting are beneficial for the fine motor development of young children. Parents, come and make this craft together with your little ones!
