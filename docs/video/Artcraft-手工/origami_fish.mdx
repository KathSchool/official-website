# Origami Fish

## Full English Craft Class: Making Origami Fish | Craft for Kids

In this video, inspired by the previous picture book "Shapes with Little Fish," we will fold origami and create little fish together! This fun origami craft class can significantly increase children's interest in learning English. Children will not only review the shape vocabulary they've learned before but also get exposed to everyday English expressions used in activities.

The all-English environment helps babies in their English enlightenment journey by immersing them in abundant English input. Teacher Katherine's authentic pronunciation also assists children in producing standard English speech.
