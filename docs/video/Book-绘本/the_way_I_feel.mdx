# The Way I Feel

## Children's English Picture Book [Understanding Emotions]: The Way I Feel

Come and read the English picture book with Teacher Katherine!

The book "The Way I Feel" uses strong, colorful, and expressive images, paired with simple poetic verses, to help children connect words with emotions. Children will learn useful vocabulary, giving parents and teachers more opportunities to have conversations about events in the child's life.

This picture book also helps children identify and express their feelings in a positive way, which is crucial for their social-emotional learning, empathy development, and building resilience. Emotions are neither good nor bad, and children need to use language to express their feelings, just like they use language to express everything else in the world.
