## English Picture Book Teaching | Opposites | Antonyms | Story Reading

In this video, we bring you the classic picture book "Opposites," where children can learn many pairs of antonyms in English through reading.
The illustrations in the picture book are vibrant, rich, and interesting. Coupled with Teacher Katherine's wonderful and exaggerated performance, we believe that kids will enjoy it and benefit from it.
