## Introduction

Mother's Day is approaching, and here, in advance, we wish all mothers a happy holiday
In this video, children will read the classic English picture book "My Mum." We believe that every mom has some similarities with the mom in the book
This is the best reading for Mother's Day! Let's read the picture book with the children together
