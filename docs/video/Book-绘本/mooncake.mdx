## Introduction

Hello, dear parents! In this video, we want to share a heartwarming and sweet children's picture book called "A Big Mooncake for Little Star." This story is perfect for children to experience in the midst of such a festive atmosphere.

As the saying goes, "There are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people's hearts." After hearing this story, you might also have some unique thoughts and insights.

My takeaway from this book is that it vividly illustrates the reasons behind "the moon shines bright" and "the full moon turns to a new moon." Everything seems a bit absurd but strangely reasonable. After reading it a few times, I came up with a new interpretation: "Perhaps the mooncakes we eat are the moons from another world."

Upon careful consideration, unexpected interpretations may arise. That's the charm of a good picture book!

I'm really looking forward to hearing your interpretations as well, so please feel free to leave comments below.
