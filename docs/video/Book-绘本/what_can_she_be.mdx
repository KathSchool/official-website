## Introduction

The release of Barbie's live-action movie reminds me of the picture book "ABC What Can She Be?" I hope every girl can have endless possibilities like Barbie, daring to dream and pursue her own career.

This is a picture book that teaches the 26 English alphabets. For babies who are starting their English learning journey, parents and friends can guide them to observe the shapes and pronunciation of the 26 letters while watching the video.

Let's take a look at what each of the 26 letters represents as a profession. What does your baby want to become when they grow up?
