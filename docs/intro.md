# Brand Introduction

Kath School is committed to creating the most vibrant English learning journey for every child, ensuring they embark on their English learning with joy.

We employ an immersive, all-English language environment to enable children to acquire a second language in authentic contexts. Our teaching objective is to help children develop native-like thinking in English and cultivate their interest in learning the language, making them fall in love with English learning. We firmly believe that a child's learning process should be filled with fun and surprises.

Picture books, nursery rhymes, arts and crafts, and physical activities are the four main pillars of Kath School's innovative teaching approach. Each of these pillars has unique advantages and positively impacts English language enlightenment:

**Picture Books:**

Picture books are books that combine images and text, capturing children's attention through visual and written elements. In English language enlightenment, picture books help children expand their vocabulary, develop language sensitivity, and foster a love for reading.

**Nursery Rhymes:**

Nursery rhymes utilize short and easy-to-remember lyrics with catchy melodies, aiding children in quickly and effectively memorizing and expressing language. In English language enlightenment, nursery rhymes enhance pronunciation accuracy, cultivate phonetic awareness, and improve memory retention.

**Arts and Crafts:**

Arts and crafts activities merge creativity with hands-on practice, providing children with communication contexts during English language enlightenment. These activities encourage children to unleash their imagination and express their ideas and creativity in English. Creating crafts related to English themes deepens their understanding of the subject matter.

**Physical Activities:**

Physical activities help children enhance experiential memory. Through games and movement, children can learn and use new English vocabulary and phrases in a joyful manner. Cooperative spirit is cultivated, and the dialogues generated during physical activities aid children in practicing English in real-life situations.

At Kath School, we not only develop children's language abilities but also focus on nurturing their interest in learning and self-confidence, allowing them to thrive in a relaxed and enjoyable learning environment.
